# WeatherAPI
An API I've created to find out the current weather for a given location
## State
- In progress
Currently working on it. I will update the README when I have completed it and provide proper information on the application.
## To-do list
- [ ] Update the weather_for_city jsp page. 
- [ ] Add Model objects to controller to display objects to the view.
- [ ] Add 5 day forecast endpoint
- [ ] Add historical 5 day forecast endpoint
- [ ] Add a list of ISO codes for countries on the weather_view jsp page
- [ ] Add JavaScript functionality to ISO code table. Make it so that they are all buttons and clicking on one automatically fills the ISO code search text box.
- [ ] Make the ISO code table smaller and searchable.
